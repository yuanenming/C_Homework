# XGBDTI: An XGBoost Ensemble Approach for Network-Based Drug-Target Interaction Prediction
XGBDTI is a computational pipeline to predict novel drug-target interactions (DTIs) from heterogeneous network.

## Requirements
The dependent packages are as following. They are easy to download using `pip` except xgboost。
* xgboost (You can download & install this package following(https://blog.csdn.net/mmc2015/article/details/44623301))
* numpy 
* sklearn 
* pandas
* scipy
* matplotlib

## Quick Start
You can just run <code>python2 main.py</code> to reproduce the cross validation results of XGBDTI. Options are:
- `-r`: negtive positive ratio, one or ten

## Tutorial
Of course, you can go through all the process by run <code>python2 totalPipeline.py</code> Options are:
- `-d`: drug network list, seperated by comma, without suffix.
- `-p`: protein network list, seperated by comma, without suffix.
- `-dm`: drug feature vector dimensions
- `-pm`: protein feature vector dimensions
- `-r`: negtive positive ratio
As for more hyperparameters in XGBoost model, you can modify them in the `src/model.py`

- `Similarity_Matrix_Drugs.txt` : Drug & compound similarity scores based on chemical structures of drugs (\[0,708) are drugs, the rest are compounds).
- `Similarity_Matrix_Proteins.txt` : Protein similarity scores based on primary sequences of proteins.
- `mat_drug_protein_homo_protein_drug.txt` : Drug-Protein interaction matrix, in which DTIs with similar drugs (i.e., drug chemical structure similarities > 0.6) or similar proteins (i.e., protein sequence similarities > 40%) were removed.
- `mat_drug_protein_drug.txt`: Drug-Protein interaction matrix, in which DTIs with drugs sharing similar drug interactions (i.e., Jaccard similarities > 0.6) were removed.
- `mat_drug_protein_sideeffect.txt`: Drug-Protein interaction matrix, in which DTIs with drugs sharing similar side effects (i.e., Jaccard similarities > 0.6) were removed.
- `mat_drug_protein_disease.txt`: Drug-Protein interaction matrix, in which DTIs with drugs or proteins sharing similar diseases (i.e., Jaccard similarities > 0.6) were removed.
- `mat_drug_protein_unique`: Drug-Protein interaction matrix, in which known unique and non-unique DTIs were labelled as 3 and 1, respectively, the corresponding unknown ones were labelled as 2 and 0.  
The above files are used to test the robustness of the model (see https://github.com/FangpingWan/NeoDTI). In addition to them, other files are provided by the project.

### `DataSet/` directory
pre-trained data set.   
The integer denotes the ratio of negative to positive.
### `feature/` directory
pre-trained vector representations for drugs and proteins.  
The integer denotes the dimension of the feature vectors.
### `network/` directory
pre-computed similarity matrices.
### `whole/` directory
This directory stores the data and program for test on the whole drug-target interaction network. And the drugs(or proteins) with no interaction was moved.  
Due to time pressure, I did not add comments. So the script in this folder is a bit confusing.
